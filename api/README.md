This directory contains the Realistic Dummy Content API
(realistic_dummy_content_api) module. It does not do anything by itself, but
allows other modules to define a directory structure similar to that in the
Realistic Dummy Content (realistic_dummy_content) module, which will contain
images and text with which to replace the dummy content generated by Devel
Generate.
