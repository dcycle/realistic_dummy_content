This directory contains the Realistic Dummy Content API (realistic_dummy_content_api) module. It does not do anything by itself, but allows other modules to define a directory structure similar to that in the Realistic Dummy Content (realistic_dummy_content) module, which will contain images and text with which to replace the dummy content generated by Devel Generate.
