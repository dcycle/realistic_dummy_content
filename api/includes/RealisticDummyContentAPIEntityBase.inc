   *   The entity type of the object, for example user or node.
   * @param $filter
   *   If set, only certain fields will be considered when manipulating
   *   the object. This can be useful, for example for users, because
   *   two separate manipulations need to be performed, depending on whether
   *   hook_user_insert() or hook_user_presave(). Both hooks need to modify
   *   only certain properties and fields, but taken together the entire
   *   object can be manipulated.
   *   The filter is an associative array which can contain no key (all
   *   fields and properties should be manipulated), the include key (fields
   *   included are the only ones to be manipulated, or the exclude key (all
   *   fields except those included are the ones to be manipulated).
   *
   *   realistic_dummy_content_api_user_insert() defines the array
   *   ('exclude' => array(picture)) whereas
   *   realistic_dummy_content_api_user_presave() defines the array
   *   ('include' => array(picture)). Therefore taken together these two
   *   hooks manipulate the entire user object, but in two phases.
