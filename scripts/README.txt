This directory contains scripts used to set up dev and testing environments with Docker.

These scripts are meant for developers of realistic_dummy_content, not for users or
site developers.

Usage

 * Install a CoreOS instance (using Vagrant for example)
 * Log in and run one of the scripts
 * A CI (continuous integration server) can run the tests on every commit

A script is also included for mirroring this directory, it is meant to be called from a continuous integration server.
