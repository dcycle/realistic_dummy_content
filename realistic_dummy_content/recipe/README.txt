This folder contains replacement data to make generated elements more realistic.
It also can contain a "recipe" subfolder which contains a recipe for generating dummy content (the order and number of each item to create). The only other subfolder which is used currently is "fields", but one could imagine replacing other data as well (menus, etc.). [Check the issue queue or open an issue](https://drupal.org/project/issues/2253941?categories=All) if you would like to work on that!
