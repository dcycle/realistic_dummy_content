The files herein are used by Realistic dummy content to replace generated content for fields in user entities.

The file path is realistic_dummy_content/fields/user/user:

 * realistic_dummy_content/fields: because all files used to replace fields are in realistic_dummy_content/fields
 * user: this is the entity type
 * user: this is the bundle (all entities must have an entity type and a bundle; in the case of "user", this requirement means that the bundle and the entity type have the same name: user).
