The files herein are used by Realistic dummy content to replace generated content for body fields in article nodes (entity type: node; bundle: article; this is determined by the directory structure).

Input formats
-------------

Note that one of the body texts has a full html input format, which is achieved using the attribute mechanism described in the documentation.

Note also that one of the files contains nothing. This is to indicate that we want the body to be empty in that case.
