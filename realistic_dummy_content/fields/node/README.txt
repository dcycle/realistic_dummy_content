The files herein are used by Realistic dummy content to replace generated content for fields in entities of type node. There will be subdirectories in here, one for each "bundle" (or content type).

About the symbolic link from "post" to "article": In Backdrop, the fork of
Drupal, article has been renamed post. Using a symbolic link here tells
Realistic Dummy Content to use the same dummy data in post (in a Backdrop
setting) as in "article". You can use symbolic links to reuse any folder.

For example if you have the same fields in two content types, you can add
a symbolic link from one to another:

    cd realistic_dummy_content/fields/node
    ln -s one_type another_type

You can do the same if you want to have the same dummy content in, say field_image in one content type as in field_image in another:

    cd realistic_dummy_content/fields/my_content_type
    ln -s ../article/field_image field_image

For another example of symbolic links see
./realistic_dummy_content/fields/user/user/README.txt.
