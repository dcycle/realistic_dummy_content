; note that we are using realistic_dummy_content_api as a dependency here purely
; as a convenience. For you own modules, this is not required. If
; realistic_dummy_content_api is active, custom demo content will be used, but
; not if realistic_dummy_content_api is disabled. The idea is to enable in on
; demo and development sites, but not on production.
