Realistic dummy content
=======================

This project is inspired by the Devel issue [Let's generate kick-ass demo content!](https://drupal.org/node/1748302), and aims to make it possible to use [Devel](https://drupal.org/project/devel)'s `devel_generate` to generate more realistic demo content.

Usage
-----

Enable this module and [Devel](https://drupal.org/project/devel)'s `devel_generate`. You will now see portraits used for profile pictures, and stock photos instead of the color blocks generated by `devel_generate`. All images included in this module are freely licensed (see the README.txt in the directories containing the images).

Extending this module
---------------------

This project contains two modules:

 * Realistic Dummy Content API (realistic\_dummy\_content\_api), which looks inside every enabled module for files which contain images or text, and replaces available fields.

 * Realistic Dummy Content (realistic\_dummy\_content), which replaces user pictures and node article images with portraits and stock photography. You can reproduce the `realistic_dummy_content/realistic_dummy_content` directory structure in your own modules for better control of the realistic dummy content you want to generate. If you don't want the example stock images that ship with this module, you can disable Realistic Dummy Content (realistic\_dummy\_content) and leave Realistic Dummy Content API (realistic\_dummy\_content\_api) enabled.

Developers can also extend Realistic Dummy Content by implementing hooks defined in `api/realistic_dummy_content_api.api.php`. Specifically, if you want to be able to define realistic dummy content for a custom field type and the standard technique is not working, you can submit an issue or patch to the [issue queue](https://drupal.org/project/issues/2253941?categories=All) for this module; but you can also implement the field modifier yourself by looking at Realistic Dummy Content API's implementation of `hook_realistic_dummy_content_attribute_manipulator_alter()`, and the classes which are referenced from there.

Creating recipes
----------------

Often, sites require a set number of entities to be created in a specific sequence. For example, if your site defines schools which have [entity references](https://www.drupal.org/project/entityreference) to school boards, a realistic scenario may be to generate 3 school boards followed by 20 schools. You can define this type of recipe for your [site deployment module](http://dcycleproject.org/blog/44/what-site-deployment-module) (or any module), by creating a file called `./sites/*/modules/mymodule/realistic_dummy_content/recipe/mymodule.recipe.inc`. [An example is included herein](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/realistic_dummy_content/tree/realistic_dummy_content/recipe/realistic_dummy_content.recipe.inc).

Field meta data
---------------

Some fields have special meta data: body fields can have input formats in addition to body text; image fields can have alt text in addition to the image. This can be achieved using a specific naming scheme, and you will find an example in the enclosed data, which looks like:

    realistic_dummy_content/fields/node/article/
      - body/
        - ipsum.txt
        - ipsum.txt.format.txt
        - lorem.txt
     - field_image/
        - 1.jpg
        - 2.jpg
        - 2.jpg.alt.txt

In the above example, `realistic_dummy_content` sees two possible body values, _one of which with a specific input format_; and two possible images, _one of which with a specific alt text_. Meta data is never compulsory, and in the case where a meta attribute is needed, a reasonable fallback value is used, for example `filtered_html` will be used if no format is specified for the body.

Continuous integration with Circle CI
-----

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/alberto56/realistic_dummy_content) is a continuous integration platform for Drupal projects. In [Continuous integration with Circle CI and Docker for your Drupal project (Dcycle project, Feb. 20, 2015)](http://dcycleproject.org/blog/92/continuous-integration-circle-ci-and-docker-your-drupal-project), I documented how and why I set up continuous integration with Circle CI and Docker for Realistic Dummy Content.
