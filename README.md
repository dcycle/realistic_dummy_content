Realistic dummy content
=======================

Generate realistic demo content with
[Devel](https://drupal.org/project/devel)'s `devel_generate` module.

Usage
-----

Enable this module and [Devel](https://drupal.org/project/devel)'s
`devel_generate`. You will now see portraits used for profile pictures, and
stock photos instead of the color blocks generated by `devel_generate`. All
images included in this module are freely licensed (see the README.md files in
the directories containing the images).

Extending this module
-----

This project contains two modules:

 * Realistic Dummy Content API (realistic\_dummy\_content\_api), which looks
   inside every enabled module for a specific directory structure
   (path/to/module/realistic_dummy_content) and replaces dummy content
   accordingly.

 * Realistic Dummy Content (realistic\_dummy\_content), which replaces user
   pictures and node article images with portraits and stock photography. You
   can reproduce the `realistic_dummy_content/realistic_dummy_content`
   directory structure in your own modules as
   `my_custom_module/realistic_dummy_content` for better control of the
   realistic dummy content you want to generate. If you don't want the example
   stock images that ship with this module, you can disable Realistic Dummy
   Content (realistic\_dummy\_content) and leave Realistic Dummy Content API
   (realistic\_dummy\_content\_api) enabled.

Developers can also extend Realistic Dummy Content by implementing hooks
defined in `./api/realistic_dummy_content_api.api.php`. Specifically, if you
want to be able to define realistic dummy content for a custom field type and
the standard technique is not working, you can submit an issue to the [issue
queue](https://drupal.org/project/issues/2253941?categories=All), or a
[pull request](https://github.com/dcycle/realistic_dummy_content) for this
module.

Which version to use
-----

Use the 7.x-1.0-beta7 version only if you are using PHP 5.3 or earlier. All other users should use x.x-2.x versions.

Creating recipes
-----

Often, sites require a set number of entities to be created in a specific
sequence. For example, if your site defines schools which have [entity
references](https://www.drupal.org/project/entityreference) to school boards, a
realistic scenario may be to generate 3 school boards followed by 20 schools.
You can define this type of recipe based on the example at
[./realistic_dummy_content/recipe](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/realistic_dummy_content/tree/realistic_dummy_content/recipe/realistic_dummy_content.recipe.inc).

Once your recipe is written, you can run it (create the content) using Drush:

    drush generate-realistic

See `./realistic_dummy_content/recipe/README.md` for more details.

Field meta data
-----

Some fields have special meta data: body fields can have input formats in addition to body text; image fields can have alt text in addition to the image. This can be achieved using a specific naming scheme, and you will find an example in the enclosed data, which looks like:

    realistic_dummy_content/fields/node/article/
      - body/
        - ipsum.txt
        - ipsum.txt.format.txt
        - lorem.txt
     - field_image/
        - 1.jpg
        - 2.jpg
        - 2.jpg.alt.txt

In the above example, `realistic_dummy_content` sees two possible body values,
_one of which with a specific input format_; and two possible images, _one of
which with a specific alt text_. Meta data is never compulsory, and in the case
where a meta attribute is needed, a reasonable fallback value is used, for
example `filtered_html` (Drupal 7) or `basic_html` (Drupal 8) will be used if no
format is specified for the body.

Issue queue and pull requests
-----

See the [issue queue](https://drupal.org/project/issues/2253941?categories=All) if you have questions, bug reports or feature requests.

Pull requests can be filed against the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dcycle/realistic_dummy_content).

Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 in one "universal" codebase
-----

The 7.x-2.x and 8.x-2.x codebases are identical and both work on Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 sites. This is discussed inthe blog post ["Can the exact same module code run on Drupal 7 and 8?", Dcycle Blog, Feb. 28, 2017](http://blog.dcycle.com/blog/7b285da4/same-module-drupal-7-and-8).

Docker integration (2.x branch only)
-----

To test this module you can run:

    cd ./development && ./test.sh

To create a development environment for Drupal 7, make sure you have Docker installed (for example on a CoreOS vagrant machine on Mac OS), then you can run:

    cd ./development && ./build-dev-environment.sh

This will install two development environments, one for Drupal 7 and one for Drupal 8. When you change any code, it will reflected in both your environments in real time.

Continuous integration and automated tests
-----

Automated tests are run using
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dcycle/realistic_dummy_content),
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker), Drupal's Simpletest (which
is being phased out because it's slow), and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de).
Linting is being run for PHP and shell files.
