# The LXC driver does not support exec, see
# https://circleci.com/docs/docker/#docker-exec; the solution suggested in
# the documentation does not work, so we will try a different approach:
# Because Circle uses LXC and does not support exec, we'll use
# our run scripts instead. Instead of executing a command on an
# existing container, run-*.sh will create a new
# container linked to our database, run a command, and destroy the
# container thereafter.
