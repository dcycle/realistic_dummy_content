Realistic dummy content
=======================

This proejct is inspired by the Devel issue [Let's generate kick-ass demo content!](https://drupal.org/node/1748302), and aims to make it possible to use [Devel](https://drupal.org/project/devel)'s `devel_generate` to generate more realistic demo content.

Usage
-----

Enable this module and [Devel](https://drupal.org/project/devel)'s `devel_generate`. You will now see portraits used for profile pictures, and stock photos instead of the color blocks generated by `devel_generate`. All images included in this module are freely licensed (see the README.txt in the directories containing the images).

Extending this module
---------------------

This project contains two modules:

 * Realistic Dummy Content API (realistic_dummy_content_api), which looks inside every enabled module for files which contain images or text, and replaces available fields.
 
 * Realistic Dummy Content (realistic_dummy_content), which replaces user pictures and node article images with portraits and stock photography. You can reproduce the `realistic_dummy_content/realistic_dummy_content` directory structure in your own modules for better control of the realistic dummy content you want to generate.
 
Next steps
----------

This module is in early stages of development but should be working. See the [issue queue](https://drupal.org/project/issues/2253941?categories=All) if you have questions, bug reports or feature requests.
