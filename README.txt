Realistic dummy content
=======================

This proejct is inspired by the Devel issue [Let's generate kick-ass demo content!](https://drupal.org/node/1748302), and aims to make it possible to use [Devel](https://drupal.org/project/devel)'s `devel_generate` to generate more realistic demo content.

Usage
-----

Enable this module and [Devel](https://drupal.org/project/devel)'s `devel_generate`. You will now see portraits used for profile pictures, and stock photos instead of the color blocks generated by `devel_generate`. All images included in this module are freely licensed (see the README.txt in the directories containing the images).

Extending this module
---------------------

This project contains two modules:

 * Realistic Dummy Content API (realistic\_dummy\_content\_api), which looks inside every enabled module for files which contain images or text, and replaces available fields.

 * Realistic Dummy Content (realistic\_dummy\_content), which replaces user pictures and node article images with portraits and stock photography. You can reproduce the `realistic_dummy_content/realistic_dummy_content` directory structure in your own modules for better control of the realistic dummy content you want to generate. If you don't want the example stock images that ship with this module, you can disable Realistic Dummy Content (realistic\_dummy\_content) and leave Realistic Dummy Content API (realistic\_dummy\_content\_api) enabled.
